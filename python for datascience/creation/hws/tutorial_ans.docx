Practice Questions

1. What is the difference between a list and a tuple?
A list is mutable, while a tuple is immutable. Their syntax: 
List: food=[]
Tuple: food=()

2. How do you define a function in Python?
You define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. Example:
def my_function():
    pass

3. Write a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

4. How do you handle division by zero in Python? 
we can handle division by zero using try-except block. for eg.
try:
    result=10/0
except zeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")

5. What is a dictionary in Python?
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. For eg:
my_dict={"book":"reverend insanity","author":"gu zhen ren"}

6. Give an example of an f-string. 
name = "Alice"
age = 30
greeting = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

7. Explain the purpose of __init__ in a class. 
The purpose of __init__ is to initialize the attributes of a class when an object is created.
It is called the constructor method.

8. How do you comment a single line in Python? 
You comment a single line in Python using the # symbol. For example:
# This is a single line comment

9. What is the difference between == and =?
The main difference is that = is an assignment operator while == is a comparison operator.

10. Write a Python code to check if a number is even or odd. 
number = 10
if number %2 ==0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("odd")

11. How many spaces should you use per indentation according to PEP8? 
PEP8 recommends using 4 spaces per indentation level.

12. What is the difference between append() and extend() in a list? 
The difference is that append() adds a single element to the end of the list,
while extend() adds multiple elements from an iterable (like another list) to the end of the list.

13. How can you import only one function from a module? 
We can import a single function from a module using the from keyword. for eg.
from math import sqrt

14. Write a lambda function to add two numbers. 
add = lambda a,b:a+b

15. What are *args and **kwargs? 
*args is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function while
**kwargs is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.

16. Explain the difference between try-except and if-else. 
try-except is used for handling exceptions that may occur during code execution,
while if-else is used for conditional branching based on boolean expressions.

17. How do you print all keys of a dictionary? 
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
for key in my_dict.keys():
    print(key)

18.What is the use of the pass statement? 
The pass statement is used as a placeholder in Python. It allows you to write code that does nothing,
which can be useful when you want to define a function or class that you plan to implement later

19. Give an example of a Python constant. 
PI = 3.14159

20. Write a Python program to print the square of each number in a list using a loop.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num**2)
